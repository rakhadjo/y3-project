This report encapsulates a project aimed to create a Universal Simulator for Cellular Automata. The motivation in creating this project is presented upfront in the beginning, followed with the necessary concepts and background knowledge necessary to build the tool. The project's architecture will be described, and its implementation will be discussed. Design decisions are also justified as to why a specific technology was used, and perhaps why others were not. Feedback for this project is then provided by the intended audience, i.e. University Students in Computer Science, to gain insight to its usability. This project report will finish with a summary of achievements, reflection, and potential extension work.
