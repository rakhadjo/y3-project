%% The third-rep class and this starter kit were written by 
%% Graham Gough <graham@cs.man.ac.uk>
%% If you have any comments or questions regarding this document,
%% please post them to the local newsgroup man.cs.tex.

%% This skeleton report is organised as a master file called
%% report.tex which then includes files for individual parts including
%% abstract.tex, chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex, chapter3.tex and
%% appendix1.tex.  

%% The third-rep style is a locally created style based on the
%% standard LaTeX report style. If you really want to have a look at
%% it, its source can be found in
%% /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/mancs/third-rep.cls
%%
%% More information about LaTeX in general and the local setup in
%% particular can be found on the web at 
%% http://csis.cs.manchester.ac.uk/software/contrib/latex

%% This is an example of how you load extra packages.
%% Some packages are already loaded in the third-rep class

\usepackage{url} % typeset URL's sensibly

\usepackage{pslatex} % Use Postscript fonts

%% The best way to latex just one chapter is to uncomment lines such as
%% the next:
%\includeonly{chapter1}

%% This defines the title (the \\ forces a line break)
\title{A Universal Cellular Automata Simulator}
%% and author
\author{Rakha Djokosoetono}
%% and supervisor
\supervisor{Uli Sattler}
%% and the year of the report
\reportyear{2022}

%% this defines the file that contains the text of the abstract, there
%% must be one of these by the time you submit your report.
\abstractfile{abstract.tex}

%% this defines the file that contains the acknowledgements (it can be
%% omitted if you don't feel like thanking anyone
%% \thanksfile{merci.tex}

%% Uncomment the following lines if you want to include the date as a
%% header in draft versions. See the documentation for fancyhdr for
%% more ways of modifying headers (texdoc fancyhdr will show you the
%% docs) 

%\usepackage{fancyhdr}
%\pagestyle{fancy}
%\lhead{}  % left head
%\chead{Draft: \today} % centre head
%\lfoot{}
%\cfoot{\thepage}
%\rfoot{}

%% The following line sets up the use of PostScript fonts rather
%% than the standard bitmapped fonts.
\usepackage{pslatex}

%% Uncomment the following line if you want to change the name of the
%% Bibliography to References
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

\usepackage{listings}

                                % the references are printed, other
