> <b>Project Brief</b>: <br />  <br />
> Conway's Game of Life (CGoL) is a fascinating alternative to Turing machines: like Turing machines, CGoL is universal, i.e., it captures the essence of computability/decidability. It also is very simple and looks like an 8 bit Arcade game. <br /> <br />
> For this project, you will learn about CGoL and why it is universal. Then you build a piece of software with a suitable graphical user interface that simulates and shows the behaviour of CGoL. Finally, you pick a suitable target audience (e.g., A level students) and turn this into a learning tool for this audience to learn about CGoL and evaluate its usefulness. <br /> <br />
> This is a flexible project and you can focus on various aspects of it. A student taking this project will need to acquire knowledge about CGoL and its relation to Turing machines and should be happy to create a non-trivial code base with a suitable UI. <br /> <br />
> Deliverable: CGoL learning application; small study to evaluate its usefulness.
